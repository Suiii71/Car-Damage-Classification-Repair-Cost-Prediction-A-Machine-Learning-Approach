# Car-Damage-Classification-Repair-Cost-Prediction-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
Vehicle accidents happen every day, and each incident leads to some form of damage. 
In most cases, trained workers inspect the vehicle to estimate the cost of repair.
This manual process takes time and may vary from person to person.
It is now possible to automate parts of this inspection.
In this repository, everything is included to address this problem from dataset to code and execution.
